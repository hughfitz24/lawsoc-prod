      <h3 id="the-plan">The Plan</h3>
      <p>
        The UCD Law Society needed a modern, lightweight, and easily
        maintainable website to showcase events, archives, and society news.
        When I approached this task, the tech stack of LawSoc was a strange one.
        A WordPress instance was being hosted on a shared VPC with our domain
        provider, which was expensive and also uneditable! We had lost access to
        the WordPress instance, so our website was essentially useless. I
        decided to take on the development, and give my first full-stack project
        a go!
      </p>
      <p>
        Low cost was a priority here, so I decided to go with a cloud native
        approach. We were paying a hefty amount for our shared VPC, and the
        cloud native philosophy of “pay for what you use” was very appealing for
        a low cost development.
      </p>
      <h3 id="technical-stack">Technical Stack</h3>
      <p>
        To get a balance between simplicity, performance, and cost, I opted for
        a static-site architecture with selective dynamic elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Static Hosting: Google Cloud Storage Buckets with HTML/CSS/JS
          frontend.
        </li>
        <li>CDN &amp; Security: Cloudflare CDN with proxy and caching.</li>
        <li>
          Minimal Dynamic Content: A serverless function for retrieving API keys
          for dynamic content rendering.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="deployment-optimization">Deployment &amp; Optimization</h3>
      <p>
        The site is deployed as a static HTML site, removing the need for
        database dependencies. I chose the below deployment strategies to
        maximise performance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cloudflare Caching – Reducing server load and improving response
          times.
        </li>
        <li>
          CI/CD Principles - Changes to the site are deployed through a GitHub
          Action, authenticating to GCloud and publishing changes to the bucket.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="maintenance-future-expansion">
        Maintenance &amp; Future Expansion
      </h3>
      <p>
        A big priority in this project was easy maintenance, I won’t be around
        the society forever, so I needed to make sure it could be worked on
        without proprietary knowledge of web dev. The system is designed to be
        low-maintenance, with updates of upcoming society events being handled
        with a mini Google Calendar trick:
      </p>
      <p>
        To update events for the homepage, it is handled through a Google
        Calendar. Whoever wants to add an event to the front page adds the event
        to a specific Google Calendar (access to this calendar is very
        granular!). When the front page page is loaded, a JS function makes a
        call to the API to access the event details, and dynamically generate
        HTML that displays these events on the homepage! The API key is fetched
        using a Cloud Function - the calendar is public, and the API key is read
        only, so the security of this key is not paramount. It doesn’t retrieve
        any info that you couldn’t just find on the Google Calendar itself!
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step in development is updates handled through Markdown-to-HTML
        conversion. This allows for easy content management without the need for
        a full CMS. This is a fun aspect to the development that will be sure to
        play out in an interesting way.
      </p>
      <h3 id="how-i-broke-our-dns">How I Broke Our DNS</h3>
      <p>It&#39;s always the DNS…</p>
      <p>
        Part of the new design was to migrate our DNS management to Cloudflare.
        This provides us a secure CDN, with better support for caching.
      </p>
      <p>
        When migrating over our DNS, and connecting to our new nameservers, I
        made the mistake of not moving our MX DNS records. This essentially
        broke our connection to Google Cloud for our email hosting. Thankfully,
        this issue only persisted for about a day or so. The email issue was
        pointed out to me, I checked back and realised my mistake, and updated
        our records accordingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another relief was the fact that most modern email providers will
        attempt emails repeatedly for up to 72 hours. Emails that we did not
        receive due to this error were then subsequently received in inboxes.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it was a pain at the time, it taught me a
        good lesson about DNS management. This mistake definitely
        won&#39;t be repeated!

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        With this foundation, the UCD Law Society website is built to be fast,
        secure, and future-proof. I prioritised low-cost development, with a
        cost reduction from 70 Euro Per Year to just over 6 Euro Per Year
        (projected by GCP). This was a great project, and many thanks to Emma
        and the rest of the LawSoc team for letting me take it on!
      </p>

        Off to learn DNS properly now...
