                <p>The weekly house debate is a cornerstone of the Law Society.</p>
                <p>Throughout its existence, the Law Society has held debates discussing almost every topic, including a televised presidential debate in 2011.</p>
                <p>As one of UCD's debating unions, the Law Society is committed to preserving the art of discourse and oration through its weekly house debate, continuing our storied tradition.</p>

            <div id="conc">
                <p>The LawSoc house debate has long been a major event on campus, with a packed chamber being a frequent sight in our long history.</p>
                <p>The debate follows a structured format: speakers deliver 7-minute speeches, with the middle 5 minutes open to points of information.</p>
                <p>Each debate revolves around a set motion, with three (or sometimes four) speakers arguing for and against. The winner is decided by a popular vote of the attending members.</p>
                <p>The motion and guest speakers are organized by our Debates Convenors. If youâ€™re interested in becoming a convenor, keep an eye on our social media for committee openings!</p>
