                <h2>UCD Maidens Debating</h2>
            </div>
            <p>The Law Society, alongside the Literary and Historical Society, runs two Maidens Debating Competitions a year. Open to all students with no college debating experience, this is the starting point of many illustrious debating careers.</p>
            <p>The first competition is the James Joyce Maidens competition. Run over a series of Monday nights in the first semester, this competition is not only a great way for students to get into debating but also a place where many friendships are first formed. This competition sees participants compete as individuals, receiving their motions a week in advance. The current champion is Mya Madigan of the Law Society.  </p>
            <p>The second competition is the Maidens Mace Competition. This is a one day British Parliamentary style competition for teams of two. The mace format means that teams get fifteen minutes to prepare their motions before the start of the debate. The current champions are Coleman Hegarty and Joseph Duffy, both of the L&amp;H. </p>
