            <h3>Freshers&#39 Week Events</h3>
            <p>
            Kick off the year in style with our Freshers&#39; Week activities! We
            organize pub quizzes, scavenger hunts, and social nights, all designed
            to help new students settle in and make friends. Whether you&#39;re
            testing your trivia skills or just here for the craic,
            Freshers&#39; Week is the perfect introduction to LawSoc.
            </p>
            <h3>Mystery Bus</h3>
            <p>
            Think you can handle the unknown? Our Mystery Bus events are some of the most exciting nights out 
            of the year. Hop on board and prepare to be whisked away to a secret location for a night
            you won’t forget. Just show up, trust the plan, and let the adventure
            unfold! Last year we ended up in Galway, who knows where we will end up next? 
            </p>
            <h3>The Law Ball</h3>
            <p>
            A highlight of the academic year, the Law Ball is the ultimate
            black-tie event. Held in semester two, it’s a night of elegance,
            entertainment, and celebration, featuring a stunning venue, a
            three-course meal, and plenty of dancing. Don’t miss your chance to
            experience one of the most opulent student events in UCD, and don't miss your 
            chance to become Law King or Queen for your year group either! You better start campaigning soon...
            </p>
            <h2>And More!</h2>
            <p>
            Beyond these signature events, we also host nights out,
            post debate socials, and special themed nights
            throughout the year. Whether you&#39;re looking for ballgowns and tuxedos or just a great night out, LawSoc has something for you.
